                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p>
                    Art was my first passion before stepping into IT. As a sheltered child, I spent most of my time indoors, 
                    immersed in video games and creating artwork. While coding isnâ€™t my strongest skill, design is where I thrive. 
                    My goal is to merge creativity and technology to become a successful game producer.
