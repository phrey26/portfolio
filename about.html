                <p>
                    Web development was not my first choice, heck it wasn't even a choice. I was an irresponsible person, hence landing at this course and choosing the Web Development major at random. I hated this course and coding which made me mediocre at coding. My dream course was arts and I always dreamt of attending an art school, but art schools are expensive and because of the competition of landing a job in the art school it made me skeptical to enroll on it. While I was at this major I discovered web designs and UI/UX desings. That's when WebDev started to grow on me, maybe I can become a web designer. I'm also very passionate at video games and try to make mods, fan-game and simple video games. I can become a Web Designer and work my way up into a game designer or game producer. Come look at my work and I hope this pleases you.
